"""Phase 2 — swarm tool injection.

`_inject_swarm_tools` is the single place that mutates a Hermes AIAgent's
`.tools` / `.valid_tool_names` (replacing ~16 copy-pasted reach-in blocks). These
tests exercise that real code against a fake agent — the prior MockAIAgent in
test_swarm.py overrode `_ensure_agent`, so this injection had NO coverage.
